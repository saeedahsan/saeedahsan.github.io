<h1>Ahsan Saeed's Portfolio</h1>
<p>Hello World! Welcome to my portfolio website. This page is currently a work in progress, but feel free to look around!</p>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>I'm currently a first-year student studying at the University of Toronto Scarborough. My major is in computer science, specializing in the software engineering stream.</p>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>Here are some projects I'm currently working on, or have completed in the past.</p>
<h3>Side Projects</h3>
<p>These projects were completed from scratch. Their source code can be found on my <a href="https://www.github.com/saeedahsan" target="_blank">Github page.</a></p>
<h4>Classic Snake Game</h4>
<ul>
<li>Currently working on re-creating the classic snake game using Python.</li>
<li>This is the classic game many people have experience playing.</li>
<li>Python's Tkinter is used for the GUI using OOP style.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Text-based RPG Android Application</h4>
<ul>
<li>Currently working on a text-based role playing game using Android Studio.</li>
<li>This application uses a simple binary tree to keep track of the story itself and the choice of actions the user selects.</li>
<li>Currently working to improve the UX design and complete the story.</li>
<li>This application is likely to be put up on the Google Play Store, so stay tuned!</li>
</ul>
<h4>Alarm Android Application</h4>
<ul>
<li>Completed an alarm managing application during the summer of 2020.</li>

<li>A SQLite database is used to keep track of saved alarms.</li>
<li>This was my first independent project using Android Studio.</li>
</ul>
<h3>School Projects</h3>
<p>These projects were completed as academic assesments. Most, if not all of these projects had some starter code, which included variable and function declarations. The functionalities, however, were done independently.</p>
<h4>C Graphs Project (CSCA48H3: Introduction to Computer Science II)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Coming soon!</li>
</ul>
<h4>C Binary Trees Project (CSCA48H3: Introduction to Computer Science II)</h4>
