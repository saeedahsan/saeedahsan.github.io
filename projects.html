<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>Here are some projects I'm currently working on, or have completed in the past.</p>
<h3>Side Projects</h3>
<p>These projects were completed from scratch. Their source code can be found on my <a href="https://www.github.com/saeedahsan" target="_blank">Github page.</a></p>
<h4>Classic Snake Game</h4>
<ul>
<li>Currently working on re-creating the classic snake game using Python.</li>
<li>This is the classic game many people have experience playing.</li>
<li>Python's Tkinter is used for the GUI using OOP style.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Text-based RPG Android Application</h4>
<ul>
<li>Currently working on a text-based role playing game using Android Studio.</li>
<li>This application uses a simple binary tree to keep track of the story itself and the choice of actions the user selects.</li>
<li>Currently working to improve the UX design.</li>
<li>This application is likely to be put up on the Google Play Store, so stay tuned!</li>
</ul>
<h4>Alarm Android Application</h4>
<ul>
<li>Completed an alarm managing application during the summer of 2020.</li>
<li>This application was created from scratch as a final project for Harvard's CS50x course.</li>
<li>A SQLite database is used to keep track of saved alarms.</li>
<li>This was my first independent project using Android Studio.</li>
</ul>
<h3>School Projects</h3>
<p>These projects were completed as academic assesments. Most, if not all of these projects had some starter code, which included variable and function declarations. The functionalities, however, were done independently.</p>
<h4>C Graphs Project (CSCA48H3: Introduction to Computer Science II)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Independently created a social media simulation as a project using graphs.</li>
<li>The simulation contains 'users' and 'companies' whose relationships ('followers' and 'friends') between each other are stored using a graph.</li>
<li>The graph's nodes (users/companies) have both direct and indirect edges to represent friends and followers respectively.</li>
<li>Recieved a mark of 94% on the project.</li>
</ul>
<h4>C Binary Trees Project (CSCA48H3: Introduction to Computer Science II)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Successfully completed an image processing program by using binary trees.</li>
<li>The idea is similar to a quadtree, but with regions breaking into two smaller regions recursively instead of four.</li>
<li>Recieved a mark of 90% on the project.</li>
</ul>
<h4>C Linked Lists Project (CSCA48H3: Introduction to Computer Science II)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Created a simple version of the turtle graphics engine using linked lists.</li>
<li>Recieved a mark of 95% on the project.</li>
</ul>
